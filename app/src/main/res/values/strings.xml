    <string name="sample_text">
        Newly released court documents show that Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos
        communicated with several senior campaign officials about his outreach to the Russian government
        over a period of months. The recipients of Papadopoulos’s emails are not named in the filings,
        but The Washington Post has identified several individuals based on interviews and other documents.
        Papadopoulos pleaded guilty this month to lying to federal agents about his outreach to Russia.
        “The Campaign Supervisor”: Trump campaign national co-chairman Sam Clovis
        Victoria Toensing, an attorney for Sam Clovis, confirmed that several references in court filings
        to “the campaign supervisor” refer to the onetime radio host from Iowa, who served as Trump\'s
        national campaign co-chairman. At one point, Papadopoulos emailed Clovis and other campaign
        officials about a March 24, 2016, meeting he had in London with a professor, who had introduced
        him to the Russian ambassador and a Russian woman he described as “Putin\’s niece.”
        The group had talked about arranging a meeting “between us and the Russian leadership to
        discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump,” Papadopoulos wrote. </string>
